This is a python programe , which gives all the valid word from provided character.
I have made this programe to solve android game 'Word Legend'.

For word_solution.py to run it requires words_dictionary.json file to be present in same directry
as my python file is.

I have got this file from this source
https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json

Thanks for its creaters, for its licence so i can use it.
